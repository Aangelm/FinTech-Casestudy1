* My point of interest and discussion is centered around the company named CUBE Global. 
* CUBE was founded in 2011 by Ben Richmond, CEO and Founder, who is said be driven by a vision of the future of regulatory compliance. This vision to found this company and build reglatory programs and platforms came about after the 2008 Financial Crisis occured. This was a demand that was affecting financial sectores worldwide.
* In a climate of little oversight within big banks and financial markets the requirement to have regulatory compliance implemented became paramount. This need was coupled with the innovation of using technology to enhance the capabilities of the ever changing regulatory climate and implementation of sound compliance practices with efficiency and overhaul of outdated manual practices.
