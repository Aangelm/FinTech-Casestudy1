# **FinTech-Case Study **

# **REGULATORY TECH/REGTECH**

## Insight into the world of RegTech for the Banking and Finance Industry
---


* My point of interest and discussion is centered around the company CUBE Global
* CUBE is a privately held company and was founded in 2011 by Ben Richmond, he is also the current CEO, who was said to be driven by a vision of the future of regulatory compliance.  The vision to create this company and build regulatory programs and platforms came about after the 2008 Financial Crisis occurred. The demand for this innovative idea in an area of lack was affecting financial sectors worldwide. 
* In a climate of little oversite within big bank and various types of financial markets, the requirement to have regulatory compliance implemented became paramount.  This need was coupled with the innovation of using technology to enhance the capabilities of the ever-changing climate and implementation of sound compliance practices with efficiency and the overhaul of outdated manual practices of data pull.

## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
---
* Some of the specific financial challenges that this company is trying to solve is the client company’s adaptation to quick regulatory changes to become and remain compliant.  Also, the implementation of automation of processes via technology to improve efficiencies and keep with adherence to the laws that govern financial markets. 
* The company’s intended customers were the big banks and numerous financial markets that must follow any regulation. CUBE began abroad offering services into larger institutions across Europe, Australia, and the Americas. They have over 200 employees and span 11 countries. Entities that CUBE obtained contracts with are HSBC, Zurich, Deutsche Bank and Revolut which is an fintech bank in UK.  They are now offering more services to smaller banks and financial markets.  
* Regulatory product solutions are geared toward Privacy Data Records, Cybersecurity Technology Risk, Financial Crime and AML.  COVID has distinctly shown a rise in financial fraud.  
* Using AI and machine learning, the platforms are geared towards quick accurate and progressive results to assist in regulatory exam, internal and external audits.   Strictly using these technologies can minimize the manual time to pull reports and time it takes to gather data without having much human error.

## LANDSCAPE
---

* Regulatory Tech (RegTech) is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry through technology.  Groups of companies use cloud computing technology through software-as-a-service (Saas) to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively.  There are currently over 250 RegTech companies. 
* The implementation of platforms has grown over the last 10 years and just as recent as September of this year rolled out RegAssure offering simple set up and log on program ran by AI to pinpoint regulations that your organization needs quickly. They have partnered with VigilantCS as an Integration partner, Advisor and consulting partner Sionic, 
Additionally, they partner with firms Hitachi Vantara for data storage and analytics and PwC for Audit and consulting.
* Competitors include but not limited to:  AML Partners, LLC, Venture Radar, Sky.flow, SCI WEB, Chainanalysis.
Many of the competitors do not offer such an expansive footprint nationally or worldwide


## RESULTS
---

* Abroad there seems to be more of an acceptance to try these platforms out. CUBE has over many active account contracts
* The new programs/platforms they have to offer are expansive and exciting from an auditor perspective as well. 
* The AML program for instance uses AI in the new program platform RegAssure
* Examples of platforms offered are: 
    - RegBrain
    - RegBook
    - RegInsight
    - RegReport
    - RegProfile
    - RegOntology
    - RegFlow
    - RegTransform
    - RegAssure

   



## RECOMMENDATIONS
---
* In response to the “contact us forms” for the demonstrations on the website it was revealed that CUBE does not cater to small banks, just large and midsize financial institutions. The recommendation is that they should advertise correctly on the website and not include that language referring to small size business if it’s not accurate. They should include the size by dollar. 
* Working in smaller community banks has many challenges with data pulls for audits, the work is mostly manual and dependent on spreadsheet reports.  While some banks have become more digitally data driven, for the most part there are only canned reports that do not lend to check for regulation parameters at all.  Business analytics reports are built to order but the same as the canned reports as they do not assist with the compliance needs of the Bank. A risk/compliance department manually sends out publications of changes or additions to regulatory adherence internally. Even compliance quarterly meetings only track via cumbersome spreadsheets if findings were completed or pending completion. FinTech products are offered at the customer level but not the employee level to produce the work more efficiently. My second recommendation would be to create a division within the company that caters to small banks and financial markets. 
* Within the division created for smaller institutions, create date packages and pricing to accomodate the needs of those community banks. Create a webinar to discuss the process to move over to this technology including but not limited to discussion regarding: how it really works, what the results are on an annual basis, how much revenue can you save that institution? How will these platforms streamline so many processes?  How long will it take to prepare these smaller banks to have the addition of these platforms? What are the training programs offered?  In the United States, combining forces with the accounting groups that audit banks and perhaps petitioning the federal regulating agencies to require banks to update technological processes to track adherence to regulations.
